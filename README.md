# Oyunum

My experimental game project with C++, Allegro, and Lua.

This will be a 2d tite based jump and run, along the lines of Jill of the Jungle by Epic Megagames,
or perhaps Commander Keen.

- C++ 11/14
- Allegro 5.2
- Lua 5.3.4
- Using my [manualbind](https://github.com/merlinblack/manualbind) project.
